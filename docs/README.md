A framework for building intelligent personal assistants.

# Quick Start

First, get the code on your system!

The simplest method is by using [Brain tool](https://github.com/brain-ai/tool):

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/brain-ai/tool.git
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The tool will install the dependencies and set up Brain.ai in your system based from your preference.

Brain.ai provides its own executable file, therefore, using the terminal, you can simply navigate inside the [assistant](https://github.com/brain-ai/assistant) instance generated by the setup tool and type:

``` bash
brain start
```

Brain.ai will load the settings and brain configuration of the assitant, the output should look like the following:

``` bash
REST API: listening on port 5000
 * Serving Flask app "brain" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
Trigger Engine: standby for hotword detection...
```

Trigger the default hotword by saying "assistant". You should see that the hotword engine woke the instance:

``` bash
2018-05-22 18:02:55,950 :: INFO :: Keyword 1 detected at time: 2018-05-22 18:02:55
Say something!
```

Then you can say "hello assistant" and wait for the response:

``` bash
Google Speech Recognition thinks you said hello assistant
Order matched in the brain. Running synapse "greetings-hello"
Waiting for trigger detection
```

That's it! You are now ready to customize your own intelligent personal assistant!
